# MagicGatherer_Frontend
This is the frontend of my MagicGatherer project. It is built using React with TypeScript, Redux, and React Router.

- Web API: https://github.com/burgerax5/MagicGatherer_API
- Web Scraper: https://github.com/burgerax5/CardKingdomWebScraper

## Setup
First go to: `src/api/config.ts` and set the value of `apiURL` to the name of the backend web API (https://github.com/burgerax5/MagicGatherer_API) when it is run. e.g. `https://localhost:44321`

Now install all the packages from the command line:
```
npm i install
```

After all the packages are installed you should be able to run it using:
```
npm run dev
```
